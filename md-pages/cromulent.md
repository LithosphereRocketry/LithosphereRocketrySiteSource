# The Cromulent Computer Checklist

> adjective. crom·​u·​lent ˈkrä-myə-lənt. informal + humorous. : acceptable, satisfactory.

*from Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary*

The following is a set of goals that one can aspire to in building a homebrew
computer system, whether it be a clone of an existing design, a new design built
around off-the-shelf core components, or an entirely homemade architecure. The
aim of this listing is to provide a set of basic functions to aspire to such
that, if all are implemented, your computer might be useful to someone who
actually wants to use a computer.

# Goals

1. Display information to a user in human-readable format, whether on a screen,
  nixie tubes, serial terminal, or paper print-out.
2. Take input from the user in some vaguely usable way such as a keyboard.
3. Compute some piece of analysis that would be difficult, tedious, or
  otherwise impractical to do by hand.
4. Load and store data from a preexisting, non-hardware-specific source in a way
  that other contemporary or preexisting devices can understand.
5. Load, modify, and save a text document to persistent digital storage.
6. Write and run a program in a high-level, non-assembly language.
7. Play a game or otherwise provide entertainment capable of holding a user's
  attention for more than a few minutes.

# Example: Atari 800

Let's see how a classic system fulfils these requirements:

1. Information is displayed via RF modulator to a conventional TV.
2. Input is taken via keyboard, joystick, or a few other specialty peripherals.
3. Rendering the Mandelbrot set is a popular example among hobbyists.
4. Data can be received and sent from contemporary computers via the optional
   300-baud modem expansion.
5. Numerous text editing programs existed, such as Panther and the Atari BASIC
   editor. Files can be loaded and saved on tape and floppy disk.
6. BASIC was natively supported, and third-party programs allowed a variety of
   other languages such as LISP.
7. Many games were released for the system; I myself am partial to Dig Dug.*

> \* I am partial to it mainly because for a while I used an Atari with a broken
     start button, and Dig Dug allows the game to start by pressing the joystick
     button instead.
